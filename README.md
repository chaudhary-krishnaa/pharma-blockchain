pharma blockchain
The pharmaceutical industry is fundamental to global healthcare, ensuring the production and distribution of essential medications. However, it faces significant challenges, including counterfeit drugs, supply chain inefficiencies, and transparency issues. Counterfeit medications not only pose serious health risks but also weaken trust in pharmaceutical systems. Traditional tracking mechanisms rely on centralized databases, which are susceptible to data manipulation and fraud. These vulnerabilities highlight the urgent need for a secure, decentralized solution that guarantees the authenticity of medications across the supply chain.

Blockchain technology provides an innovative solution by offering a decentralized, tamper-proof system for tracking pharmaceutical transactions. By eliminating reliance on a central authority, blockchain ensures that each drug batch remains verifiable from production to final consumption. Blockchain's core features—immutability, transparency, and security—make it a powerful tool for preventing counterfeit drug distribution and strengthening consumer trust.

Pharma Chain is a blockchain-based pharmaceutical tracking system designed to address these supply chain vulnerabilities. Initially developed as a command-line interface (CLI) tool, Pharma Chain evolved into a Flask-based web application, enhancing usability while preserving decentralized security. The system leverages SHA-256 hashing for transaction integrity, peer-to-peer (P2P) networking for transparent data sharing, and a web interface for seamless stakeholder interactions.

















Objectives of Pharma Chain:
•	Develop a blockchain-based pharmaceutical tracking system that records every transaction immutably.

•	Ensure decentralized batch tracking, allowing verification across manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies, and consumers.


•	Implement SHA-256 hashing algorithms for data security and tamper-proof record-keeping.

•	Transition from a CLI-based tool to a Flask web application, enhancing accessibility.


•	Enable consumer verification of drug authenticity using unit IDs stored in blockchain records.

Pharma Chain introduces transformative benefits to pharmaceutical logistics, enhancing supply chain security and consumer confidence. By integrating blockchain technology with a user-friendly web interface, the system minimizes fraud, prevents counterfeit circulation, and ensures transparent verification for all stakeholders. Decentralized authentication removes the need for expensive third-party validation, making Pharma Chain cost-effective and scalable for industry-wide adoption.

Pharma Chain follows a structured workflow, ensuring that drug authenticity is maintained throughout its lifecycle. The system operates through a four-step tracking process: manufacturers register batches, distributors verify transactions, pharmacies confirm drug sales, and consumers authenticate purchases. A workflow diagram illustrating Pharma Chain's process is provided below.





 
Methodology
2.1 System Architecture
Pharma Chain is designed as a blockchain-powered pharmaceutical tracking system, ensuring secure and tamper-proof transactions across the supply chain. The architecture integrates decentralized ledger technology, Flask web-based interaction, and peer-to-peer networking to enhance accessibility while maintaining security.
The system consists of four primary components: 
•	Blockchain Ledger: Ensures immutable storage of pharmaceutical transactions. 
•	Flask Web Application: Provides an intuitive interface for interacting with Pharma Chain. 
•	Peer-to-Peer Network: Establishes decentralized communication between nodes. 
•	Verification Mechanism: Enables consumers and stakeholders to authenticate drug batches.
The transition from CLI to Flask transformed Pharma Chain from a manual, command-line blockchain tracking tool into an accessible web-based system, improving usability while preserving decentralization.

2.2 Blockchain Framework
The backbone of Pharma Chain is its blockchain infrastructure, which secures pharmaceutical transactions using SHA-256 hashing and previous block references.
•	Block Structure: Each transaction is recorded in a block containing batch ID, manufacturer details, production & expiry dates, and a cryptographic hash.

•	Chain Integrity: Every new block references the previous block’s hash, ensuring that records remain tamper-proof.

•	Proof-of-Existence: Stakeholders can verify drug authenticity by tracing the batch’s blockchain history.








Example code demonstrating block creation and hashing:
import hashlib
import json

class Block:
    def __init__(self, index, timestamp, batch_id, manufacturer, drug_name, quantity, mfg_date, expiry_date, previous_hash):
        self.index = index
        self.timestamp = timestamp
        self.batch_id = batch_id
        self.manufacturer = manufacturer
        self.drug_name = drug_name
        self.quantity = quantity
        self.mfg_date = mfg_date
        self.expiry_date = expiry_date
        self.previous_hash = previous_hash
        self.hash = self.calculate_hash()

    def calculate_hash(self):
        block_string = json.dumps(self.__dict__, sort_keys=True)
        return hashlib.sha256(block_string.encode()).hexdigest()
This ensures data integrity by utilizing cryptographic hashing, preventing unauthorized modifications to pharmaceutical records.








2.3 Flask Web Interface
To enhance usability, Pharma Chain integrates a Flask-based web dashboard, replacing manual CLI operations with a user-friendly graphical interface.
•	Batch Registration: Manufacturers register drug batches via a web form.

•	Verification System: Consumers enter a batch or unit ID to check authenticity.

•	Transaction Logs: Distributors and pharmacies verify drug movement through a blockchain-backed history log.
Example Flask route handling drug batch registration:
@app.route('/add-batch', methods=['POST'])
def add_batch():
    if request.form['passcode'] != PASSCODES['manufacturer']:
        return render_template("add_batch.html", error="Incorrect passcode")

    batch_id = request.form['batch_id']
    drug_name = request.form['drug_name']
    manufacturer = request.form['manufacturer']
    quantity = int(request.form['quantity'])
    mfg_date = request.form['mfg_date']
    expiry_date = request.form['expiry_date']

    prev_block = blockchain.get_latest_block()
    new_block = Block(
        index=prev_block.index + 1,
        timestamp="now",
        batch_id=batch_id,
        drug_name=drug_name,
        manufacturer=manufacturer,
        quantity=quantity,
        mfg_date=mfg_date,
        expiry_date=expiry_date,
        previous_hash=prev_block.hash
    )
    blockchain.add_block(new_block)
    
    return redirect(url_for('show_batches'))
This ensures secure batch registration, preventing fraud in drug manufacturing and distribution.

2.4 Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Communication
To maintain decentralization, Pharma Chain employs P2P networking, allowing nodes to communicate and share blockchain updates securely.
•	Node Registration: New nodes connect via a bootstrap server. 

•	Transaction Broadcast: Each blockchain update is propagated across all active nodes.

•	Validation Mechanism: Nodes verify transaction integrity before accepting new blocks.
Example P2P node communication script:
def handle_client(conn, addr, blockchain):
    try:
        data = conn.recv(4096).decode()
        message = json.loads(data)
        if message['type'] == 'BLOCK':
            block_data = message['block']
            block = Block.from_dict(block_data)
            if blockchain.add_block(block):
                print(f"[NODE] Block accepted from {addr}: {block.batch_id}")
            else:
                print(f"[REJECTED] Invalid block from {addr}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"[ERROR] {e}")
    finally:
conn.close()
This ensures secure and decentralized transaction propagation, reinforcing Pharma Chain’s ability to operate without central control.

2.5 Security Mechanisms
Security in Pharma Chain is enforced through cryptographic hashing, transaction verification, and access control.
•	SHA-256 Hashing: Ensures each block remains immutable and tamper-proof.

•	Passcode-Based Authentication: Limits batch modification access to authorized stakeholders.

•	Transaction Logs: Maintain a verifiable history of pharmaceutical transactions, preventing fraud.
2.6 Network Design and Decentralization
While Pharma Chain is conceptually designed to operate as a decentralized blockchain network, the current prototype simulates a single-node environment. The system stores transactions in a local blockchain file (blockchain. Json) without live peer-to-peer (P2P) communication or consensus protocols.
In a fully decentralized implementation, a bootstrap server is typically used to help new nodes discover peers. After this discovery phase, nodes operate independently and propagate verified blocks to their peers. However, Pharma Chain does not currently implement a real bootstrap server or networked nodes; this functionality is proposed for future versions.
Key Observations:
•	All block updates currently occur on a single server node.

•	There is no real-time block propagation across networked clients.

•	Consensus mechanisms (e.g., Proof of Work, PoA) are not yet implemented.
Despite these limitations, Pharma Chain lays the groundwork for a decentralized architecture by using immutable block linking (previous hash) and role-based access control for verifying updates.

import hashlib
import json
import time

class Block:
    def __init__(self, index, timestamp, batch_id, manufacturer, drug_name, quantity, mfg_date, expiry_date, previous_hash):
        self.index = index
        self.timestamp = timestamp
        self.batch_id = batch_id
        self.manufacturer = manufacturer
        self.drug_name = drug_name
        self.quantity = quantity
        self.mfg_date = mfg_date
        self.expiry_date = expiry_date
        self.previous_hash = previous_hash
        self.hash = self.calculate_hash()

    def calculate_hash(self):
        block_string = json.dumps(self.__dict__, sort_keys=True)
        return hashlib.sha256(block_string.encode()).hexdigest()
This class ensures secure data recording by hashing transaction details. The block index, drug batch ID, manufacturer details, and timestamps are stored immutably.

Blockchain Class: Maintaining the Chain:
The blockchain module appends new transactions while ensuring integrity.

class Blockchain:
    def __init__(self):
        self.chain = [self.create_genesis_block()]

    def create_genesis_block(self):
        return Block(0, str(time.time()), "GENESIS", "System", "None", 0, "NA", "NA", "0")

    def get_latest_block(self):
        return self.chain[-1]

    def add_block(self, new_block):
        new_block.previous_hash = self.get_latest_block().hash
        new_block.hash = new_block.calculate_hash()
        self.chain.append(new_block)
This structure ensures tamper-proof chain linking, preventing unauthorized modifications. The genesis block initializes the system, and each new block references its previous hash, reinforcing integrity.

3.3 Flask Web Interface
Pharma Chain’s transition to a Flask-based web UI enhances accessibility and usability. The following sections showcase full-length Flask implementations for key functionalities.
Flask App Initialization:
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify, render_template
from blockchain import Blockchain

app = Flask(__name__)
blockchain = Blockchain()
This initializes the Flask application and the blockchain system.

Batch Registration:
Manufacturers register new drug batches via the web interface, which updates the blockchain.

@app.route('/add-batch', methods=['POST'])
def add_batch():
    batch_id = request.form['batch_id']
    drug_name = request.form['drug_name']
    manufacturer = request.form['manufacturer']
    quantity = int(request.form['quantity'])
    mfg_date = request.form['mfg_date']
    expiry_date = request.form['expiry_date']

    prev_block = blockchain.get_latest_block()
    new_block = Block(
        index=prev_block.index + 1,
        timestamp=str(time.time()),
        batch_id=batch_id,
        drug_name=drug_name,
        manufacturer=manufacturer,
        quantity=quantity,
        mfg_date=mfg_date,
        expiry_date=expiry_date,

    )
    blockchain.add_block(new_block)
    
    return jsonify({"message": "Batch added successfully", "batch_id": batch_id})
This ensures real-time drug batch registration, directly updating the blockchain.

Batch Verification: Consumer Drug Authentication:
Consumers verify drug authenticity using batch IDs stored in the blockchain.

@app.route('/verify', methods=['GET'])
def verify():
    batch_id = request.args.get('batch_id')
    for block in blockchain.chain:
        if block.batch_id == batch_id:
            return jsonify({"status": "Valid", "manufacturer": block.manufacturer, "drug_name": block.drug_name, "expiry_date": block.expiry_date})
    return jsonify({"status": "Invalid", "message": "Batch not found"})
This allows consumers to validate drug authenticity, ensuring they are purchasing genuine medications.
